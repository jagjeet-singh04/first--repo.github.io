    <P> now we will know about </P>
    <p>tables and lists</p>
    <p>if you want to create the ordered lists then just type the ul inside this just type li then it will create an unorderd list it means it will create bullet pints </p>
    <ul>
        <li>this is an unorderd list</li>
        <li>this is an unordered list</li>
        <li>this is an unordered list</li>
    </ul>
    <p>if we specify the type ex- square, disc, circle then it will be acc to this </p>
    <ul type = "square">
        <li>this is an unordered list </li>
        <li>this is an unordered list </li>
        <li>this is an unordered list</li>

        <li>
 <ul>
                <li>this is an list inside the list </li>
    </ul>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th> Sno. </th>

                <td> 2</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>now if we want to create the form then we will just type the form just enter and just simply give the action as backend.php </p>
    <form action="backend.php">
        <label for="name"> name </label>
        <div><!-- div is used for division -->
            <input type="text" name = "myname" id="name"> <!--here you can input the text and give the heading as name -->

        <br>
        <div>
            class : <input type="text" name = " myclass">

        <div>
            <input type="checkbox" name = "myeligibility" id = "eligibility">
            <!-- checkbox is used for giving the checkbox if we will write checked then it is already checked   -->

        <br>
        <div>
            gender: male<input type="radio" name ="gender"> female <input type="radio" name="gender " >
            other <input type="radio" name = "gender">
            <!-- radio is used for giving the option  -->
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <input type="reset" value = "reset now" >/
            <!-- reset is used to reset the values entered by the user  -->
            <br>
            <br>
            <input type="submit" value = "submit now">
            <!-- submit is used to submit the form  -->
        </div>
        <div>
            write about yourself: <br><textarea name="aboutyou"  cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
            <!-- textarea is used for giving the text by the user  -->
        </div>
        <label for="car"> car</label>
        <div>
        <select name="mycar" id = "car"> 
            <!-- seslect is used for selecting betweenn the given options  -->
            <option value="swf">swift</option>
            <option value="ind">indica</option>
            <!-- if we write selected in any of the option then it will be selected by default -->
        </select>
        </div>

        <p> now we will know about the inline and block elements</p>
        <P>if we want to combine the two paragraphs then we will use span to combine the elements</P>
        <p style="border: 2px solid red;"> this is paragraph with the border in it </p>
        <p style="border: 2px solid blue;"> this is also a paragraph with blue border in it </p>
        <span style="border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 68);"> this is a span which is used to combine the line</span> <span style="border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 68);"> this is also a span</span>
        <strong style="border: 2px solid red;"> this is a paragraph which is written in the bold </strong>
        <P> if we want to write everything in one line then use just 'a' instead of p which is an inline element </P>
        <a> this is by using 'a' inline element </a>
        <P>this is a paragraph</P>
        <P> now we will learn about the ids and the classes</P>
        <P> ids can be created in the div also the ids is used to uniquely identify the element 
            class is used when suppose if we have 100 elements and we have to change there colour border we will not change it alone so we will define a class then to do this 
        </P>
        <p>ids and classes</p>
        <div id = "mainBox" class = "redbg blackborder" > <!--here the class has unique id which other cannot have -->
            this is the mainBox
        </div>
        <span class="redbg"></span>
        <p> if we need the span of the class redbg so we will use shortcut so we will just type span.redbg then press enter so automatically the span will open </p>
        <span class="redbg"></span> <!-- here i typed span.redbg and then i pressed enter so this is shown -->
        <P> . is for class and # is for id </P>
        <P>similarly if we need to get the id which is the shortcut so we can just type span#mainBox and then press enter so we will get the result of the span </P>
        <span id="mainBox"></span> <!-- here i typed span#mainBox and then pressed entered so i got this -->
        <P>if we want to create div with the class which is the shortcut so we can jus type div.class.redbg.blackborder.anotherclass so ur div with the another class is also created this is shortcut</P>
        <div class="class redbg blacborder anotherclass"></div> <!-- here i just typed div.class.redbg.blackborder.anotherclass and then i pressed enter so i got this-->
        <P>there is also another shortcut by which we can get div this can be done by just typing .classname.nextclass and jsut press enter </P>
        <div class="classname nextclass"></div><!--here i just typed  .classname.nextclass and then i pressed enter and hence i got this -->
        <P> if we want 4 span then we will just type sapn.class.class2*4 then it will create 4 span</P>
        <span class="class class2">first</span><span class="class class2">second</span><span class="class class2">third</span><span class="class class2">fourth</span>
        <!-- here i just typed span.class.class2*4 and preesed enter so i got this  -->
        <p> now we will know about the html entities</p> 
        <P> if we want more than one space in the paragraph then we can do this by using  &nbsp; & nbsp; which stands for non breaking space </P>
        <P> ex - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there are mainly 4 spaces which are created using & nbsp;</P>
        <P> if we want to use greater than or lesser than sign then we need dto type & lt; and & gt; here lt stands for lesser than and gt stands for greater than </P>
        <P> ex - &lt; this is created using lt and gt &gt;</P>
        <P> if we want to give special character such as pund and copyright then we can give it by using & pound; and & copy;</P>
        <P> ex- this is pound &pound; this is copyright &copy;</P>
        <P>we can get more such entities by just searching it on google</P>
        <P>if we want an empty characater then we fcan just type  & #8203 which will create an empty cahracter </P>
        <p> this is an empty cahracter &#8203;</p>
        <P>now we will knoe about the scemantic tags we will know about that how the elements in the html are given the meaning</P>
        <P> now we will know about the schemantic tags</P>
        <P> just simply ssearch in google about the scematic tags html </P>
        <P> now we will know about the details </P>
        <details>
            this is done useing the details if we have larger content and if we and to use less space 
        </details>
        <P>the another example of the details is:- </P>
        <details>
            <summary>
                this is the another example of the details 
            </summary>
