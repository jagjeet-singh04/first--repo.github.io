    <P> this is the the paragraph  </P>
    <p> we can create multiple paragraph by using p*n here n is the no. of the paragraph ex - p*4 will create 4 paragraph </p>
    <P>now if we want the text to be in bold so we can use b tag to bold the line <b> this line is in bold </b>
    and we want the text to be in the ittalic form so we can use i tag <i>this text is in itallic type </i></P>
    <P>if we want to put the break in the line in the same paragraph we can do this by using br tag this will break the line <br> this text will be in next line but written in the samae paragraph  </P>
    <p> if we want to give the horizontal line we can do this by using hr tag this will create the line<hr> </p>
    <p> the hr tag and the br tag are the self closing tags we need not to close the tag it will automatically close the tag</p>
    <p>if we want to insert the link in the page so we can do it just by typing a  and then clicking on the first tag so 
        there you can insert the link
    </p>
    <P>here is the link to the google and linkedin </P>
    <a href="https://google.com">open google </a><br>
    <a href="https://linkedin.com">open linkedin </a>
    <p>if we want the user to open the link in the new tab so just type target = "_blank" then it will open the link in the new tab</p>
    <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">go to google</a><br>
    <a href="https://linkedin.com" target="_blank">go to linkedin</a>
    <p>now the above linkes will be opened in the new tabs</p>
    <P>if we want to insert html same process will be repeated but you just need to type in href / before giving the name of the html </P>
    <a href="/jagjeet.html" target="_blank">open my html</a>
    <p>the above link will open the html also in new tab </p>

    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/?Cryptocurrency/" alt="error loading the image ">
    <P> the above link will open the random image based onn the crypto here alt is used when the net is slow or the image does not exist </P>
    <p> if u want to create the unorderd list then use ul( unordered list ) then iside this use li to give the line </p>
    <ul>
        <li>this is an unordered list</li>
        <li>this is an unordered list</li>
    </ul>
    <p> if we want to use the cricles squares except bullet points ( which is automatically created ) 
        we can do it by specifying the type of the unordered list 
    </p>
    <ul type = "circle ">
        <li> this is an unorderd list </li>
        <li>this is an unordered list </li>
    </ul>
    <p> now if we want to create an oredred list then we can do this by using ol( ordered list) then inside this use li to give the line </p>
    <ol>
        <li>this is an ordered list</li>
        <li>this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>
    <P>if we want to give roman numbers in the ordered lis we can do this by just specifying the type of the ordered list</P>
    <ol type = "I">
        <li>this is an ordered list </li>
        <li>this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>
    <p> if we want to give the table then just use the table tag inside this use the thead tag and tbody tag so we create the table</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
               <th> sno.</th>
               <th> name </th>
               <th> class</th>
               <th> rollno.</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
             <td>1</td>
             <td>revision</td>
             <td>1</td>
             <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2 </td>
                <td> rev</td>
                <td>2 </td>
                <td> 34</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>so by this we create the table </p>
    <p>now we will know about the forms forms can be created by just typing the form and clicking the enter 
        in this we will use the action as backend.php 
    </p>
    <form action="backend.php"></form>
    <p>now we will use div (divison) it is used for dividing </p>
    <p>now we will specify the heading and the we will use input as is used for taking the input from the user </p>
    <p> here the type is text and the name is used if when we have more names the we can use name to find the equivalence vale 
        and the id is used for labelling
    </p>
    <label for="name"> name</label>
    <div>
        <input type="text" name = "name" id="name " >
    </div>
    <br>
    <label for="class">class</label>
    <div>
        <input type="number" name = "class" id = "class">
    </div>
    <br>
    <label for="rollno"> Roll no.</label>
    <div>
        <input type="number" name="rollno" id="rollno">
    </div>
    <br>
    <label for="subject">subject </label>
    <div>
        <input type="text" name="subject" id ="subject">
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        are you intersted in maths: <input type="checkbox" name = "intersted" checked>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        do you want to part in the competition: yes<input type="radio" name = "competition"> no <input type="radio" name="competition"> 
    </div>
    <br>
    <label for="subjects">choose subject in which you want to take part in the competition</label>
    <div>
        <select name="subjects" id="subjects">
            <option value="maths">maths</option>
            <option value="physics">physics</option>
            <option value="chemistry" selected>chemistry</option>
        </select>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    <input type="reset" value= " reset">
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value= "submit" >
    </div>
    <P> if we want to give the border to our paragrph then we can do it by :-</P>
    <P style="border: 2px solid red; "> this is a pragraph with the red border in it..</P>
    <P>similarly we can do for giving it the blue colour</P>
    <P style="border: 2px solid blue;"> this is a paragraph with blue border in it</P>
    <P>if we need to combine the two paragraphs then we can do it by using span</P>
    <span> this is a paragraph </span> <span> this is also a paragraph which is combined with the help of span </span>
    <P>so now we will get to know about the ids and classes. ids are used to uniquely identify the elements </P>
    <div id = "mainBox" class="redbg"></div>
    <P>if we want to give the class inside the div then there is a shortcut for this :- just type .classname and then ur div with classes si created if you 
        want two or more classes then you can just type .class1.class2 here the class1 and class2 are creaated with div
    </P>
    <div class="class1 class2">this div is created using the shortcut</div>
    <P>if we need to get the span classes and id in a shortcut way by jsut typing span.classname for class and then span#mainbox1 here . is used for class and # is used for ids</P>
    <span class="class">this is the class which is created using shortcut</span>
    <span id="id1">this is the id which is created using the shortcut </span>
    <P> if we need the multiple span then we can do this by typing span.classname*3 so here 3 classes are created </P>
    <span class="class">this is the class created using multiple span </span><span class="class"></span><span class="class"></span><span class="class"></span>
    <P> now we will know about some entities which are :- 
        for space - & nbsp;
        for greater than and smaller than - & gt ; and & lt;
        for pound - & pound; 
        for copyright - & copy; 
        for empty character- &#8203 ;
    </P>
    <P> now we will know abut the details if we have large details so it can be used</P>
    <P> ex - </P>
    <details>
        this is the details
    </details>
    <P> another ex - </P>
